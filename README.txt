Tools and open source code for IETF protocols.

We are not affiliated with the http://ietf.org (other than participation).

Projects:

	libABNF:
		An RFC-4234 ABNF parser. Copy the RFC into a new file, cut
		out everyting except the abnf and feed to this library.

		The next phase will generate C++ objects and code that
		will generate and accept the protocol.

		Other languages are planned.

		Builds:
			Visual Studio 2012
